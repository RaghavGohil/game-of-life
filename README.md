# What is this project?
This project is based on Jhon Conway's Game of Life. It's a simulator made in python 3.9.1 and pygame 2.3.0.

# Significance and need of the life game:
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine, meaning that you can create an actual working computer in this simulation. (More about this topic will be shared as I discover)

#Rules of the game:
There are three rules for this game:
-Any live or filled cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
-Any dead or 'empty' cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
-All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
